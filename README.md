### Hello everyone, I am currently in my second year as a Graphics Information Technology major. I plan to use this degree to further my knowledge and pursue a career as a front-end developer. Coding gives me an opportunity to challenge my skills and knowledge in the technology world while also working on different designs and layouts for webpages.
